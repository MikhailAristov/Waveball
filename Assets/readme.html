    <h3>Goal</h3>
    <p>Guide the glowing particle from its spawn point to the goal hidden somewhere within the level. You can only see parts of the level that the particle has illuminated earlier, so you'll have to explore it first! The particle follows the gradient of the surface as it moves over it, and dissipates if it hits an obstacle or loses all momentum. There are many levels with different obstacles, although you can only access three from the main menu.</p>
    <h3>Controls</h3>
    <p>You can only control parts of the level that are lit up:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Left click on the surface to send a single ripple. Hold down the left mouse button before releasing to send a bigger ripple.</li>
        <li>Right click on the surface to set a continuous oscillator there, making a standing wave. Hold to make a stronger oscillator. Right click on an existing oscillator to remove it.</li>
        <li>Press 'backspace' to reset all movement and oscillators in the current level.</li>
    </ul>
